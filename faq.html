						<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
						<div class="text-center">
							<h3>Medicare Referrals Accepted</h3>
							<details>
								<summary>Access to Podiatry Services</summary>
								<p>Your Foot Podiatry is accessible to everyone, and some patients may qualify for a referral under an eligible
									Chronic Disease Management Plan (CDM or EPC). This is an Australian Commonwealth Government Medicare initiative.

								<summary>Eligibility for Medicare Subsidised Visits</summary>
								<p>Patients with the following conditions may be eligible for a referral:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Long-term foot/ankle pain</li>
									<li>Diabetes</li>
									<li>Arthritis or difficulty in managing foot care</li>
									<li>Disabilities or injury</li>
								</ul>
								<p>This referral can provide up to 5 Medicare subsidised visits per calendar year. Patients are required to pay the
									full appointment fee, and Medicare will rebate a portion within 3 business days. Note that these visits are not
									bulk billed, and a gap payment is applicable for each visit. Please discuss your eligibility with your doctor.
									For more information, visit health.gov.au.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary>Private Health Insurance and Other Coverage</summary>
								<p>Patients without a referral are welcome to use their private health insurance extras. Your Foot Podiatry. We also
									welcome DVA, Workcover, and TAC patients. Please note: The provision of a referral is at the discretion of the
									doctor and is not the responsibility of Your Foot Podiatry. For any further inquiries or to schedule an
									appointment, please contact us.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary>Referrals</summary>
								<p>A referral is generally not required for podiatry services. If you have any questions or are unsure, please do
									not hesitate to call us.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary>Workcover and TAC Patients</summary>
								<p>We welcome all Workcover and TAC patients. Please note that you will be charged our standard private rate. After

							<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Private Health Insurance and Your Foot Podiatry</h3>
							<details>
								<summary>Private Health Insurance and Your Foot Podiatry</summary>
								<p>Do Podiatrists Accept Private Health Insurance?</p>
								<p>Yes, at Your Foot Podiatry, we accept all major health funds and payment types, including Medibank, Bupa, HCF,

									However, the rebate you are eligible to receive will depend on the type and level of your cover. For a more
									accurate estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses, please contact us for the relevant item numbers. You can then
									check your available cover for the current calendar year with your private health insurance provider.</p>

								<p>HICAPS (Health Industry Claims and Payment Service) is an electronic payment system used by healthcare providers
									to process private health insurance claims onsite. At Your Foot Podiatry, we offer HICAPS facilities, allowing
									your claims to be automatically processed during your appointment. This means you can claim your rebate
									immediately, reducing your out-of-pocket expenses. If the HICAPS transaction does not process successfully, you
									will need to pay the full amount upfront, and we will provide you with an invoice to submit to your private
									health insurance for reimbursement. For any further inquiries or to schedule an appointment, please contact us.

							<h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">Online Podiatry Consultations</h3>
							<p>In our busy lives, accessing professional health services can be inconvenient. That's why Your Foot Podiatry
								proudly offers online/virtual podiatry services to clients in Melbourne and across Australia.</p>
							<details>
								<summary>What Does an Online Podiatry Consult Look Like?</summary>
								<p>Experiencing pain can be frustrating, but you don't have to endure it alone. Our online consultations cut through
									the vast amounts of information on the internet, providing you with clarity on the cause of your pain and
									effective solutions. We focus on understanding your treatment goals to help you return to the activities you
									love. Online podiatry consultations allow you to receive expert care and relief from the comfort of your own
									home.</p>
								<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Prior to Your Online Consult:</h4>
								<p>You will receive an online form to fill out with relevant information before your
									appointment. A link will be sent to you to join the consultation at the scheduled time.</p>
								<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">During Your Consult:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Discuss you	r treatment goals (what you want to change)</li>
									<li>Identify the likely diagnosis</li>
									<li>Educate you on the root cause of your issue</li>
									<li>Create a personalized treatment plan to achieve your goals</li>
								</ul>
								<p>We will discuss the recommended treatment options based on your diagnosis and provide you with a clear plan, just
									as if you were seen in the clinic.</p>
								<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">How Does It Work?</h4>
								<p>A private 1-on-1 consultation is conducted via video on your mobile phone using a simple, easy-to-use platform.
									You will receive a link prior to your appointment. The platform allows us to clearly demonstrate assessment
									tests to better understand your problem, similar to an in-clinic consultation.</p>

								</p>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary>Conditions Treated Online</summary>
								<p>You may be surprised to learn that online treatment is highly effective for conditions such as heel pain, plantar
									fasciitis, and Achilles tendinitis. Hands-on treatments often provide short-term symptom relief, while a
									structured rehabilitation program offers long-term solutions. We have extensive experience treating these
									conditions through appropriate exercise and movement programs.</p>
								<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">During an online heel pain relief consultation:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>We prioritize obtaining a clear diagnosis of your injury through a range of tests, which may involve a
										referral for X-rays or Ultrasound.</li>
									<li>We provide appropriate pain-management strategies, such as offloading and taping.</li>
									<li>We prescribe a tailored rehabilitation plan to help you move well and feel great.</li>
									<li>If hands-on treatments such as shockwave therapy or dry needling are needed, we can arrange an in-clinic
										appointment.</li>
								</ul>
								<h4 style="margin-top: 20px;"	>We Successfully Treat:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Heel pain</li>
									<li>Plantar fasciitis/(plantar fasciosis)</li>
									<li>Achilles tendinitis/tendinopathy</li>
									<li>Forefoot pain/neuroma</li>
									<li>Arthritis/joint pain</li>
									<li>Shin splints</li>
									<li>Knee pain</li>
									<li>Running injuries</li>
									<li>Ingrown toenails</li>
									<li>Sports injuries</li>
								</ul>
							</details>
							<details>
								<summary>Treating Skin and Nail Conditions Online</summary>
								<p>Common complaints such as corns, warts, and ingrown toenails can be effectively diagnosed online. Ingrown nails,
									for instance, can be assessed to prevent infection or treat a current infection to avoid serious complications.
									Virtual podiatry allows us to assess your toenail, describe immediate self-treatment options (under podiatry
									supervision), and refer you to a GP or arrange an in-clinic appointment if further treatment is required. While
									we cannot provide general skin and nail care online, we can offer solutions for corns, warts, and other skin
									complaints.</p>
							</details>
							<details>
